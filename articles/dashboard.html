<p>Your package will be stored in a different folder depending on its
current state in the review process. The exact meaning of each folder is
detailed in articles from the R Journal in <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf" class="external-link">2018</a>
and <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019-1/cran.pdf" class="external-link">2019</a>,
and updated by a <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2019q1/003631.html" class="external-link">2019
mailing list post</a> (and <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q2/008084.html" class="external-link">confirmed
in 2022</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>inspect</strong>: your package is awaiting manual inspection
by the CRAN team, probably because automated tests found a problem that
is likely to be a false positive</li>
<li>
<strong>newbies</strong>: a specific queue for the manual inspection
of first-time CRAN submissions.</li>
<li>
<strong>pending</strong>: a CRAN team member has to do a closer
inspection and needs more time.</li>
<li>
<strong>human</strong>: your package has been assigned to a specific
CRAN member (with initials as indicated by <code>subfolder</code>) for
further inspection.</li>
<li>
<strong>waiting</strong>: the CRAN team is waiting for an answer
from you, e.g. because issues are present that CRAN cannot automatically
check for, such as maintainer changes (check your e-mail …)</li>
<li>
<strong>pretest</strong>: the CRAN maintainers restarted automated
tests on your package to see whether an issue has been fixed by your
action or is still present.</li>
<li>
<strong>archive</strong>: your package has been rejected from CRAN
because it did not pass checks cleanly and the problems were not likely
to be false positives.</li>
<li>
<strong>recheck</strong>: your package has passed basic checks.
Because other CRAN packages depend on yours (“reverse dependencies”), a
reverse-dependency-checking step is underway to see if your update has
broken anything downstream.</li>
<li>
<strong>publish</strong>: you’re all set! Your package has passed
the review process and will soon be available on CRAN.</li>
