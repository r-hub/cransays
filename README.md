The goal of cransays is to scrape the [CRAN incoming ftp folder](ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/) to find where each of the submission is, and to 
make a [dashboard](https://r-hub.github.io/cransays/articles/dashboard.html).

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("lockedata/cransays")
```

## Example

This is a basic example :

``` r
cran_incoming <- cransays::take_snapshot()
```

The vignette produces a [handy dashboard](https://r-hub.github.io/cransays/articles/dashboard.html) that we update every hour via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/r-hub/cransays/actions).

* Code originally adapted from https://github.com/edgararuiz/cran-stages That repository features an interesting analysis of CRAN incoming folder, including a diagram of the process deducted from that analysis.

* The [`foghorn` package](https://github.com/fmichonneau/foghorn), to summarize CRAN Check Results in the Terminal, provides an `foghorn::cran_incoming()` function to where your package stands in the CRAN incoming queue.
