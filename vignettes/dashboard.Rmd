The data in this table stems from our querying ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/.
We update it every hour. [See below](#cran-review-workflow) for a description of each 
folder meaning.

# CRAN review workflow

Your package will be stored in a different folder depending on its current state
in the review process. The exact meaning of each folder is detailed in an 
[article from the 
R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf) as well as in [another article from the same journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019-1/cran.pdf):

- **inspect**: this is your first submission or the automated tests found an 
error that requires human review.
- **newbies**: a specific queue for the manual inspection of first time CRAN submissions.
- **pending**: the CRAN maintainers are waiting for an action on your side. You 
should check your emails!
- **waiting**: packages for which the CRAN team waits for an answer from the maintainer.
- **pretest**: the CRAN maintainers restarted automated tests on your package to
see whether an issue has been fixed by your action or is still here.
- **archive**: if the package does not pass the checks cleanly and the problem
are not likely to be false positives, your package will be rejected.
- **recheck**: your package seems ready for publication. This step checks 
whether reverse dependencies will still work after the update.
- **publish**: you're all set! Your package has passed the review process and 
will soon be available on CRAN.
