The data in this table stems from our querying ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/.
We update it every hour. [See below](#cran-review-workflow) for a description of each 
folder meaning.

# Dashboard

```{r get-data}
library(dplyr)

standard_folders <- c(
  "pretest", "inspect", "recheck", "pending", "publish", "newbies", "waiting"
)

cran_raw <- cransays::take_snapshot()

cran_incoming <- cran_raw %>% 
  arrange(subfolder, howlongago) %>% 
  filter(subfolder != "archive") %>% 
  mutate(
    submitted = prettyunits::time_ago(submission_time),
    folder = ifelse(subfolder %in% standard_folders, subfolder, "human"),
    subfolder = ifelse(subfolder %in% standard_folders, NA, subfolder)
  )

write.csv(
  cran_incoming,
  paste0("cran-incoming_-", format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"), ".csv")
)
```

```{r}

# CRAN review workflow

Your package will be stored in a different folder depending on its current state
in the review process. The exact meaning of each folder is detailed in an 
[article from the 
R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf) as well as in [another article from the same journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019-1/cran.pdf):

- **inspect**: this is your first submission or the automated tests found an 
error that requires human review.
- **newbies**: a specific queue for the manual inspection of first time CRAN submissions.
- **pending**: the CRAN maintainers are waiting for an action on your side. You 
should check your emails!
- **waiting**: packages for which the CRAN team waits for an answer from the maintainer.
- **pretest**: the CRAN maintainers restarted automated tests on your package to
see whether an issue has been fixed by your action or is still here.
- **recheck**: your package seems ready for publication. This step checks 
whether reverse dependencies will still work after the update.
- **publish**: you're all set! Your package has passed the review process and 
will soon be available on CRAN.

This information is summarised in the following diagram by Hadley Wickham,
available in the [cran-stages Github](https://github.com/edgararuiz/cran-stages)
