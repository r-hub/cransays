The data in this table stems from our querying https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/.
We update it every hour. [See below](#cran-review-workflow) for a description of each 
folder meaning.

# CRAN review workflow

Your package will be stored in a different folder depending on its current state
in the review process. The exact meaning of each folder is detailed in articles from 
the R Journal in [2018](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf) and [2019](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019-1/cran.pdf), and updated by a [2019 mailing list post](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2019q1/003631.html) (and [confirmed in 2022](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q2/008084.html)):

- **inspect**: your package is awaiting manual inspection by the CRAN team, probably because automated tests found a problem that is likely to be a false positive
- **newbies**: a specific queue for the manual inspection of first-time CRAN submissions.
- **pending**: a CRAN team member has to do a closer inspection and needs more time.
- **human**: your package has been assigned to a specific CRAN member (with initials as indicated by `subfolder`) for further inspection.
- **waiting**: the CRAN team is waiting for an answer from you, e.g. because issues are present that CRAN cannot automatically check for, such as maintainer changes (check your e-mail ...)
- **pretest**: the CRAN maintainers restarted automated tests on your package to
see whether an issue has been fixed by your action or is still present.
- **archive**: your package has been rejected from CRAN because it did not pass checks cleanly and the problems were not likely to be false positives.
- **recheck**: your package has passed basic checks. Because other CRAN packages depend on yours ("reverse dependencies"), a reverse-dependency-checking step is underway to see if your update has broken anything downstream.
- **publish**: you're all set! Your package has passed the review process and 
will soon be available on CRAN.

This information is (approximately) summarised in the following diagram by Hadley Wickham,
